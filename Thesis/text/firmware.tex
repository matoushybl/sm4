\section{Development of the bare metal firmware}
\label{sec:firmware}
This section describes the development of the bare-metal firmware.
A brief introduction to the Rust programming language is given and the usage of the language for embedded systems is described in detail.
Further, some interesting parts of the firmware itself is described, alongside with the project structure, testing, etc.

\subsection{Firmware Architecture} % object dictionary, etc, dependency on RTIC, other things
\subsection{CANOpen}
\subsection{I2C}
\subsection{USB}
\subsection{Stepper control} % current setting too
\subsection{Simulated encoders}
\subsection{Device Monitoring}
\subsection{Motion Control} % psd, ramping
