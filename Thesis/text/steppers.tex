\section{Stepper motors}
\label{sec:steppers}
This section gives a brief introduction into stepper motors and their control.
First, stepper motors and their types are described.
Then, a comparison of stepper driver ICs is given and some of the motion control technologies by Trinamic are described.

Stepper motors are a type of DC motors which move in discrete steps\cite{noauthor_all_nodate,noauthor_stepper_nodate}.
Such movement is achieved by their construction - they consist of a stator and a rotor, where the stator is made of coils
(two coils form a phase) wound on ridges, whereas the rotor consists is a ferromagnetic structure - either a permanent
magnet or a variable reluctance iron core\cite{noauthor_stepper_nodate}.
