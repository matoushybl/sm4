This chapter describes the current state of the stepper motor controllers in the Robotics group and the efforts to improve it.
Ongoing efforts to use program embedded systems in the Rust programming language is also described, both in the context of our research group and also in general.
Finally, similar projects - either software or hardware wise are reported.

In the Robotics and AI research group, currently a second generation of the KM2 stepper motor controller is widely in use.
The controller utilizes an ATMega8 paired with two stepper motor controllers DRV8825, that are utilized in the form of breakout boards generally used in the now obsolete RAMPS boards.
The motor controller is controlled using the I\textsuperscript{2}C bus.
There are two major shortcomings of the driver - the used controller's I\textsuperscript{2}C peripheral's clock-stretching is not compatible with Raspberry Pi's, causing problems on clock speeds higher than 30 kHz.
The second shortcoming are the used driver chips, that are quite loud and do not support contemporary advanced features.
The boards for 3D printers are also reportedly not well designed and they may \hl{overheat}~\cite{prusa_rambo}.
