\section{Communication protocols}
\label{sec:comm_protocols}
According to the thesis instruction and the requirements \textbf{FR-04}, \textbf{NFR-02}, \textbf{C-03}, \textbf{C-05},  the stepper driver should feature CANOpen and I2C interfaces for control and configuration and the USB interface for configuration.
This section aims to give a brief overview into these communication interfaces and protocols utilized with them.
