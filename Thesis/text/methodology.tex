\chapter{Methods}
\label{ch:methods}
This chapter outlines the methods used while developing the SM4 stepper motor controller.

First, an introduction is given about the problematics of stepper motors and their control and about communication buses utilized by the project.

Furthermore, the requirements for the resulting hardware and software are set.
These requirements consist of functional requirements, non-functional requirements and constraints.

The development of two hardware revisions is described in the further sections.
The hardware design choices are described, and those are based on the requirements and related work.
Hardware design using KiCAD is outlined and preparing source data for subsequent manufacturing is described.

Furthermore, the development of the software for the stepper motor controller is illustrated.
A brief introduction to the Rust programming language is given, alongside with a more in-depth introduction to the current state of using Rust programming language for embedded systems.
Further, development of the firmware itself is outlined, with some interesting parts being described in detail.
Finally, the development of a control software usable for controlling the stepper motor controller is gone over.
